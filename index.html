    <p><strong> Hello, my name is Patrick Mahon. Welcome to my portfolio page.  I have only been working on my development skills since about November of 2018,
    but I am a hardworker and love to learn.  I found web development since I was looking to make a change in my carrer since doing sales was no longer
    working for me, and I felt a calling to understand technology more deeply.  For me, not answering that calling felt wrong and I did not feel as through
    I was accomplishing anything in my professional life.  That urge led me on a journey which took me to the coding bootcamp through the Univeristy of New Hampshire for full stack web devlopment.<br>
    This portfolio page is meant to higlight some of what I have leared in this course, which include the various technoglogies to make dynamic and 
    interesting web applications.<br>
    Thank you for stopping by.</strong>
    </P> 
    <p> For a taste, I have learned, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Firebase, SQL, MonogoDB, API's, node.js, various NPM packages and I am just getting started.</p>
