    <p><strong> Hello, my name is Patrick Mahon. Welcome to my portfolio page. I am relivately new to the field as I have been coding for about a year.
    I come from a history major background and after college I found myself selling software.  During that time however I felt a need to 
    better understand what I was selling and how it was built.  That urge led me on a journey which took me to the coding bootcamp through the Univeristy of New Hampshire for full stack web devlopment.<br>
    This portfolio page is meant to highlight some of what I have leared in the course, and also what I have built since as I sharpen my skills.</p>
    </div>
    </P> 
    <p> For a taste, I have learned, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, JQuery, React, Firebase, SQL, MonogoDB, Node.js, Python, and that is just the start.</p>
