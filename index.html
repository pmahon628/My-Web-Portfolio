    <p><strong> Hello, my name is Patrick Mahon. Welcome to my portfolio page.  I have only been working on my development skills since about November of 2018,
    but I am a hardworker and love to learn.  I found web development since I was looking to make a change in my carrer since doing sales was no longer
    working for me, and I was always interested in what made the technology I was selling work. I was also curiousif it was possible for me to learn how to make 
    the technology work.  That question led me on a journey which took me to the coding bootcamp through the Univeristy of New Hampshire for full stack web devlopment.<br>
    This portfolio page is meant to higlight some of what I have leared in this course, which include the various technoglogies to make dynamic and 
    interesting web applications.<br>
    Thank you for stopping by.</strong>
    </P>
