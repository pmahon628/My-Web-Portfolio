<P> Hello, my name is Patrick Mahon. Welcome to my portfolio to page.  I have only been working on development skills since about November of 2018,
    but I am a hardworker and love to learn.  I found development since I was looking to make a change in my carrer since doing sales was no longer
    working for me, and I was always interested in what made the technology I was selling work, and if it was possible for me to learn it.
    That journey took me to the coding bootcamp through the Univeristy of New Hampshire for full stack web devlopment.<br>
    This portfolio page is meant to higlight some of what I have leared in this course, which include the various technoglogies to make dynamic and 
    interesting web applications.<br><br> 
    Thank you for stopping by.
    </P>
