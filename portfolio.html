<h4>Portfolio page</h4>

<p>Welcome to my portfolio page.  This will have links to my github so you can see what I have been working on.</p>

      <h4>My First ever Portfolio</h4>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/pmahon628"> Here it is</a> I have learned alot and come along way as you will see.  I built this in 
        March of 2019 only a few months after I first started coding.  It was the first assignment for the bootcamp and I did not have a strong idea of 
        what I needed to do.  I was nervous and and this is what I came up with.</p>
        </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
   <h4>An attempt at JavaScript.</h4>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/pmahon628/Psychic-Game"> My first game</a> Before the bootcamp started I was most worried about JavaScript.  I did not truly know what it was and struggled with it during
        the pre work and my attempts with freecode camp and codeacademy (my main sources for knowledge prior to class.)  It might look rough
        but if you keep looking around, it gets beter, promise.
      </p>

    <div class="col-md-4">
        <h4>What else has helped?</h4>
           <p>Now is a good time as any to take a break from looking at my homework.  Instead, <a href="https://github.com/pmahon628/Coding-examples">this repository</a>
           </a> has examples of things I worked on in class or built on my own to help reinforce my skills.  I have learned that mastering
            fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JS) is extremely important to being a sucessful developer.  For me, these are some things have helped me.
          Enjoy!</p>

          <h4>Some API work.</h4>
          <p>Okay, back to <a href="https://github.com/pmahon628/Fun-with-Gifs">homework.  </a> This next homework we needed to use and API (Giphy), and make gifs appear on the screen. I worked hard on this one
          and it might be the most beautiful thing you have ever seen, just a weeks prior I turned in the psychic game
             </p>
           </div>
         <div class="col-md-4">
          <h4>Project time!</h4>
             <p>One aspect we did in class that I enjoyed alot was project one.  Through the first part of class
               we learned HMTL, CSS, Java Script, Jquery and many other associated front end technologies and a
               bit of backend with Firebase.  The link here is a project I worked on with my team.  I did a good amount of the front 
               end, with HTML and CSS using Materialize.  I hope you enjoy it. <a href="https://github.com/spbryan/project-one">Excelsior!</a> 
             </p>

            <div class="col-md-4">
              <h4>Wait, more group projects?</h4>
              <p>Yeah, thats right, more <a href ="https://github.com/Mdo352/Project-2-">projects</a>.  This project utulizes sequelize ORM, SQL, Jquery, NPM express, and the use of Materialize for a 
                framework.  I again  tackled  the  frontend of this projects utulizng  an external API for calls.  This project was in a slighty
                smaller group which I enjoyed and had more to do and more to learn.

                <h4>I Love React</h4>
                <p>I had the fortune in class of learning react. Wow, so cool.  After  struggling with  MVC  and keeping
                  track of JavaScript files and what they did, React took my worries and threw them away. It became so much easier to  work 
                  on pieces I was building and efficently build things faster and easier.  Need proof, here you go! <a href="https://github.com/pmahon628/memoryClick">Memory Click</a>

              <h4>What is next for Patrick Mahon?</h4>
              <p>To put it simply, alot.  A wise man once told me that signing up for programming is basically like signing up to
                do homework for the rest of your life.  Well, that sounds pretty great to me.  I have only just begun my journey of coding.
                There is still alot ot work to be done and I  am very excited to get into it.
